 together, and we looked for an appropriate, easy, key-protected API.

- **Third,** Drew a layout for the our website, created the repo, installed the needed npm modules and set up Travis CI
- **Forth,** Separated the team into two pairs and started working on writing the tests and the route functions (home, statics, latest, search, errors) right afterwards
- **Fifth,** We rendered the API results in the webpage
- **Sixth** Imad styled our website, and he was like this:
